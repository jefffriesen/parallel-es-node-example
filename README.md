- [x] [Webpack 2](https://webpack.github.io/docs/roadmap.html#2)

## Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jefffriesen/parallel-es-node-example.git
cd parallel-es-node-example
yarn  # Install the dependencies

Compile files in watch mode
```bash
yarn compile
```

The compiled typescript files are also distributed with this repo so you can directly run the files in the `/dist` folder without getting the compile step set up.
